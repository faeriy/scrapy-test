It aims to provide both the cheapest and the best English tutorials in the world.Learntalk's teaching methodology is different. Started by a team of linguists and teachers from Cambridge University and Berlitz, they realized current ESL didactic techniques needed refreshing. Learntalk's methodology means its instructors teach nearly exclusively by asking questions, through proprietary and relevant lesson plans, thereby engaging their students.The  team also realized that the price being charged by most online English tutorial services was not justified. The current model of online tutorials where companies rent large offices is not cost-effective or attractive to the teachers. To keep prices competitive (USD 3 per lesson) Learntalk has minimum overhead. Instead all teachers work from home and are trained and monitored remotely, automating as many of the administrative functions as possible.Learntalk's mission is to democratize language learning.

People don't have any tangible and direct filtering tools (ie: I want jazz musicians only)2. Limited and / scattered choices of musicians for direct comparison purposes3. No hindsight on how the musicians sound4. Even though rates are negotiable, people don't really know what's the split and how many middlemen are there; resulting in a more expensive rate (and poor musicians get the leftovers)5.

No direct access to end customers (in most cases they have to go through middlemen; EO, agents, etc)2. Those middlemen have limited channels to end customers3. No transparency in pricing (they only know how much they'll receive after the gig finishes)4. They're usually not paid up in front, so middlemen can easily change their schedules or cancel the orders without any consent  from musiciansBottomline: Musicians are the worst victims.----This is why we are here:1. Providing a pool of musicians alongside their profiles and media for end users to observe2. Filtering tools for potential customers to find exactly what they want3.

The system’s ability also to recognize the position of its users inside the house makes it possible to grant individual access rights to every device and for every user. Your cleaning lady surely requires different access rights than your children. Your spouse requires different access rights than the gardener. Adaptive Home Automation makes it possible to manage all these access rights and to serve each user in just the way he deserves it. If the system is able to recognize you and your current position it becomes all of a sudden really automated because all this annoying but unfortunately necessary interaction between you and your system disappears.As a side effect people who are not recognized by the system –burglars for example – don’t have a chance to use any of the home’s devices. No door, no locker, no drawer, not even a single water tap can be used without granted access rights. That makes the system the most secure home automation solution.It is not the substitution of a key but the reinvention of the way we get access to our homes. A real keyless home with an intelligent and invisible fence to protect the things we love."
